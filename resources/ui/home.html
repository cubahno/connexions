<h3>Connexions</h3>


<b>Connexions</b> is a library inspired by <a href="https://github.com/spec-first/connexion" target="_blank">Connexion</a>.<br/>
Connexion allows you to set up a REST API with Swagger documentation and OAuth2 authentication with minimal effort.<br/><br/>

Connexions takes this one step further by allowing you to define <b>multiple APIs</b> not limited to only Swagger and(or) OpenAPI.<br/>
You can define single response for any arbitrary path on the fly.<br/>

<h3>Goal</h3>
<ul>
    <li>- simplify the development process</li>
</ul>

<h3>Features:</h3>
<ul>
    <li>Randomized response contents, allowing you to redefine the response for any path in a locale of your choice</li>

</ul>
